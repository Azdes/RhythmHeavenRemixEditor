# Privacy Policy and your Data

## What kind of data?
RHRE collects some analytical information, **exclusively for statistical and research purposes**.
[In its entirety](core/src/main/kotlin/io/github/chrislo27/rhre3/analytics/AnalyticsHandler.kt), it only
consists of a randomly generated UUID, the program version, your Java
version, your operating system name and version, your screen size,
your timezone, and the language you use RHRE in. Additionally,
certain events will also be collected.

## Why?
This is only to understand the range of machines that run RHRE.
The UUID is only used to uniquely identify each machine. Please note that
this is *per-machine*, and not per-person! If the same person uses multiple
machines, they will have multiple UUIDs!

## Who's it shared with?
The only person who can see this data is myself, through the Segment Dashboard and Debugger.
It is not distributed to any other entity.

## Where is it stored?
As I don't personally store any of your data,
you should refer to [Segment's Privacy Policy](https://segment.com/docs/legal/privacy/)
for more information.

## Everything else?
Please refer to [Segment's Privacy Policy](https://segment.com/docs/legal/privacy/),
as they are the data processor.

## Opting out
To opt out, use the [launch argument](docs/Launch-arguments.md) `--no-analytics`.<br>
As no personal information is collected, the collecting of anonymous data
for the sole purpose of research and statistics is permitted without
explicit affirmative consent. Please see [Recital 26 of the GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-26/)
for more information if you are a citizen of the European Union.
