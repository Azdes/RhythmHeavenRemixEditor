# Privacy Policy

## What kind of data?
RHRE collects some analytical information. [In its entirety](core/src/main/kotlin/io/github/chrislo27/rhre3/analytics/AnalyticsHandler.kt), it only
consists of a randomly generated UUID, the program version, your Java
version, your operating system name and version, your screen size,
your timezone, and the language you use RHRE in.
The only *personal data* is your randomly generated UUID.

## Why?
This is only to understand the range of machines that run RHRE.
The UUID is only used to uniquely identify each machine. Please note that
this is *per-machine*, and not per-person! If the same person uses multiple
machines, they will have multiple UUIDs!

## Who's it shared with?
The only person who can see this data is myself, through the Segment Dashboard and Debugger.
It is not distributed to any other entity.

## Where is it stored?
As I don't personally store any of your data,
you should refer to [Segment's Privacy Policy](https://segment.com/docs/legal/privacy/)
for more information.

## Everything else?
Please refer to [Segment's Privacy Policy](https://segment.com/docs/legal/privacy/),
as they are the data processor.
