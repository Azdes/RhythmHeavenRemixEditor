# Custom Sounds

RHRE has supported custom sounds for quite a while. You
can simply drop in .ogg, .mp3, or .wav files in a folder inside of
the custom sounds folder (found at `<user>/.rhre3/customSounds`).

You can read the `README_SFX.txt` file in that folder that is generated after launching
RHRE at least once for more information.

If you're handy with JSON, you can leverage the full power of the
cue system using the definitions [in this article](JSON-object-definitions.md).

>Note: For RHRE versions *before* v3.11.0, the `customSounds` folder
was made next to the jar file.
