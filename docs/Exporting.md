# Exporting your remixes

Once you're done your remix, and you've ended it with an End Remix entity (looks like two vertical bars, found in Other > Special Entities), you can export it to a sound file.<br>
Click the export button on the toolbar: ![export](readme/toolbar/export.png)

And you'll be sent to the Export Remix screen.<br>

There are a lot of options here.<br>
The green bar allows you to trim how much of the remix to export.
Left click will set the beginning, right click will set the end, pressing `R` will
reset the bar to the entire remix, and holding `SHIFT` while clicking will
round to the nearest beat.

The "Upload immediately" button will jump straight to uploading on [picosong](https://picosong.com). This is really useful for sharing short snippets of your remix to people for suggestions.

Once you're set, click the bottom button to choose a file to export to.<br>
Accepted file types are: mp3, ogg, flac, wav.

>The prompt for picosong uploads will only appear if you initially exported
the remix as an mp3 file. The maximum file size is 15 MB. [picosong](https://picosong.com)'s
