# Exporting your remixes

So, you've made your remix and it's all ready to go. How do you distribute it?

**Starting in `v3.3.0`**, you can now export remixes as WAV files directly.
You should probably convert these to a compressed format like MP3 or OGG.

You could also simply distribute the `rhre3` file.
Other people with the program can open them and listen to it.

The last alternative is to record it in [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/).
Setting up Audacity to record program audio is beyond the scope of this doc page,
and can be Googled easily.
