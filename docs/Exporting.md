# Exporting your remixes

So, you've made your remix and it's all ready to go. How do you distribute it?

The first and easiest option is to simply distribute the `rhre3` file.
Other people with the program can open them and listen to it.

The second and most common option is to record it in [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/).
Setting up Audacity to record program audio is beyond the scope of this doc page,
and can be Googled easily.

**Starting in `v3.3.0`**, you can now export remixes as WAV files directly.<br>
Do note the following:<br>
1. You must use the Beads sound system. [Information on changing the sound system and its requirements are here.](Sound-systems.md)
2. It may not be perfect. I've tried my best to make it as accurate as possible,
but nothing will be as perfect as recording the program audio.
