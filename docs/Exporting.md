# Exporting your remixes

So, you've made your remix and it's all ready to go. How do you distribute it?

**Starting in `v3.3.0`**, you can now export remixes as WAV files directly.<br>
**Starting in `v3.5.0`**, you can now also export to MP3.
**Starting in `v3.7.0`**, you can now directly upload exported MP3 files to [Picosong](https://picosong.com)!

>The prompt for Picosong uploads will only appear if you exported
the remix as an mp3 file. The maximum file size is 15 MB. Picosong's
[Terms of Service](https://picosong.com/tos)
and [Acceptable Use Policy](https://picosong.com/aup) apply.

You could also simply distribute the `rhre3` file.
Other people with the program can open them and listen to it.

The last alternative is to record it in [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/).
Setting up Audacity to record program audio is beyond the scope of this doc page,
and can be Googled easily.
