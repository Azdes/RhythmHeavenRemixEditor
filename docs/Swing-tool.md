# Swing tool

The Swing tool allows you to have parts of your remix have a [swing rhythm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(jazz_performance_style)).
This can be extremely useful for songs that do have a swing rhythm, or
if you want to make a custom game with a "bouncy" rhythm (Lockstep 2 comes to mind).

Swing is controlled by *individual* tempo changes. To edit them, you will use the
Swing tool (press **`6`**, or click the button in the bottom-right).

>If you want to change the swing setting (straight to swing, or vice-versa) but keep the same tempo, you'll have to place another tempo change with the same tempo and a different swing setting.

**`Scroll`** on *a tempo change* to change the swing ratio. Your
options are below:

| Swing Name | Swing Ratio |
|------------|-------------|
| Straight | 50% |
| Light Swing | 60% |
| Swing | 67% |
| Hard Swing | 75% |

A ratio of 50% means 50% of the time will be an on-beat, and 50% of the time will be an offbeat.<br>
Likewise, Swing's 67% means on-beats are 67% of the time, and offbeats are the other 33%, causing a swinging rhythm.

Holding **`CTRL`** will change the ratio in increments of 1%.<br>
Holding **`CTRL+SHIFT`** will change the ratio in increments of 5%.

If you hold **`SHIFT`** and **`scroll`**, you will change the division setting.
You can change it between eighth notes and sixteenth notes. This decides
how "onbeats" and "offbeats" are decided (every eighth note or every sixteenth note).
