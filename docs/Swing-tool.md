# Swing tool

The Swing tool allows you to have parts of your remix have a [swing rhythm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(jazz_performance_style)).
This can be extremely useful for songs that do have a swing rhythm, or
if you want to make a custom game with a "bouncy" rhythm (Lockstep 2 comes to mind).

Swing is controlled by *individual* tempo changes. To edit them, you will use the
Swing tool (press **`6`**, or click the button in the bottom-right).

>If you want to change the swing setting (straight to swing, or vice-versa) but keep the same tempo, you'll have to place another tempo change with the same tempo and a different swing setting.
