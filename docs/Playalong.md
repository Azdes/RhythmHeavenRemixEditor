# Playalong

The Playalong mode is the biggest added feature in RHRE, starting with
v3.17.0. It lets you assign controls in your remix and then actually
play along!

## Adding input entities
Go to Other ➡ Special Entities ➡ Playalong Input Entities and place down
the various input types. You have access to both button-based controls and
RHDS touchscreen controls.

>Note: Quiz Show's "count inputs" control method doesn't exist. Also, Rockers's 
"hold L/R" input does not exist; please use a different Hold input instead.
