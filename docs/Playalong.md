# Playalong

The Playalong mode is the biggest added feature in RHRE, starting with
v3.17.0. It lets you assign controls in your remix and then actually
play along!

## Playalong Settings
Right click the Playalong button in the toolbar to access the Playalong Settings.
You can calibrate your keyboard and mouse lag *independently*, adjust SFX settings,
and the control scheme used.

## Adding input entities
Go to Other ➡ Special Entities ➡ Playalong Input Entities and place down
the various input types. You have access to both button-based controls and
RHDS touchscreen controls.

>Note: Quiz Show's "count inputs" control method doesn't exist. Also, Rockers's 
"hold L/R" input does not exist; please use a different Hold input instead.

## Challenge Settings
You can set some challenges while you play along. Included are
the Perfect Challenge, Monster Goal (get aces to survive), Tempo Up, Tempo Down,
and Life Goal.
